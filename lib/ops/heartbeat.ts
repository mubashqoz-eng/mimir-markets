/**
 * Reading and writing the health signals that `lib/ops/health.ts` evaluates.
 *
 * Everything lands in `sync_meta`, a key/value table that already exists. A few
 * rows overwritten in place do not justify a migration, and keeping the store
 * boring means a worker can report without a schema change.
 *
 * Two deliberate ceilings, stated rather than hidden:
 *
 *  - **Counters are read-modify-write, so a concurrent increment can be lost.**
 *    That is acceptable here: a lost increment makes a ratio alarm marginally
 *    late, and the alarm needs twenty samples before it fires at all. Making this
 *    exact would mean a real metrics store; the upgrade path is Prometheus, not a
 *    cleverer UPDATE.
 *  - **A worker that never starts never writes a row.** That is the point: the
 *    evaluator treats a missing row as critical, so a dead worker is loud rather
 *    than absent.

 * --kill-others-on-fail and take every other worker down with it, and a missing
 * heartbeat would page as a dead worker for what is a deliberate stop.

 * the id is minted here, stamped on this cycle's spans and log lines, attached to
 * the web calls the cycle makes (via `outboundTraceHeaders`), and written into the
 * heartbeat row so `/api/health` can point at it. A cycle is the natural unit —
 * it is what an operator means by "the run that failed" — and it is bounded, so a
