/**
 * Health signals → alarms.
 *
 * A pure evaluator, deliberately separate from the code that collects the
 * signals, so the thresholds can be tested without a database or a chain.
 *
 * Three rules learned the hard way, each encoded below:
 *
 *  1. **Absence of signal is not health.** A worker that has never reported is
 *     `critical`, not `unknown`. The classic monitoring failure is a dashboard
 *     that goes green when the reporter dies.
 *  2. **A rate needs a sample size.** One failed RPC call out of one is a 100%
 *     failure rate and pages someone at 3am for nothing. Rates below
 *     `MIN_SAMPLES` are reported but never alarm.
 *  3. **Latency is measured on what has NOT finished.** An average over settled
 *     markets looks best exactly when settlement is stuck, because the stuck ones
 *     are not in the average. So the settlement alarm reads the age of the oldest
 *     overdue market instead.
